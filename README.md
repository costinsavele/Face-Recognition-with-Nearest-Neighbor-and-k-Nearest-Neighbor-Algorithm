# Face-Recognition-with-Nearest-Neighbor-and-k-Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm
Utilize OpenCV, NumPy, and statistical analysis to recognize faces from the ORL dataset. Compute recognition rates and execution times with various distance metrics (Euclidean, cosine). Visualize results using matplotlib and Plotly.
